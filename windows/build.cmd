:: this script is to build 3dtk on 64bit windows with visual studio 2015
:: if you require support for 32bit windows, please send patches
:: this was tested on Windos 10 64bit

:: To run CL.exe manually from a terminal, you must first setup your
:: environment using a call to
:: C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\VC\vcvarsall.bat

:: the path where the 3dtk sources are
set sourcedir=%~1

if "%sourcedir%" == "" (
	echo "Usage: %0 sourcedir outdir"
	exit /B 1
)

:: the path where you want the resulting binaries
set outdir=%~2

if "%outdir%" == "" (
	echo "Usage: %0 sourcedir outdir"
	exit /B 1
)

:: the build type (one of Debug, Release, RelWithDebInfo and MinSizeRel)
set buildtype=Release

:: The source directory must not be in the root of a drive letter under
:: windows. See:

::
:: The output directory must *not* be a network drive or otherwise Windows
:: will refuse to load any dll from it.
::
:: Also, *never* change this file while the script is still running. It seems
:: that on windows, the script is not read into memory and executed by the
:: interpreter but instead read on demand.

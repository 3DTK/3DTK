This project is part of the 3D Toolkit (3DTK).
-------------------------------------------------------------------

To compile the project simply call "make". This will configure 3DTK-planes using the
default settings. If you wish to configure the project using custom settings do:
you may change into the build directory ".build" and configure the
project with your preferred cmake configurator, i.e.:
cd .build && cmake -i ../

For Microsoft Windows, use the cmake-gui application provided by cmake to
configure and generate project files for the appropriate version of visual
studio of your system. Use the INSTALL target to built the entire project.
Executables (and .dll's) will then reside in the "windows" folder.

For a detailed explanation of the functionality of the programm, please

Hough Transform for Plane Detection in Point Clouds - A Review and A new

March 2011.

One example scans is included in the dat directory, several
larger data sets can be downloaded from the data repository,
http://kos.informatik.uni-osnabrueck.de/3Dscans/
(Alternatively, click on the "Data Repository" link on this project's
web site on Sourceforge, http://slam6d.sourceforge.net/)

IMPORTANT;
For detecting planes compile slam6D with the WITH_PLANE option.
Adapt the settings in bin/hough.cfg for your data set.

Extremely large scans might need to be reduced before registration. 
Use the -r option to use an octree based reduction of the scan. 
It is highly recommended to use the -O option as well for reduction to chose
points randomly (instead of the center) from the octree voxels.

For a list and description of all the parameters run without any parameters
bin/planes

EXAMPLES:
(using the data set in the slam6d repository)
bin/planes dat

(using octree based reduction of the scan with voxel size 10 and 3 points from each voxel)
bin/planes -s 0 -r 10 -O 3 dat

(using octree based reduction of the scan with voxel size 10 using the center of each voxel)
bin/planes -s 0 -r 10 dat

The generated output is written to the directory specified in the config file in
bin/hough.cfg (default: dat/planes).
The output contains a file planes.list that lists the files containing the
detected planes. Each file with the name planeXXX.3d (with XXX numbers in
increasing order) specifies the 3D points of the convex hull of the largest
cluster detected on the plane.

To view the result with the viewer from slam6d
bin/show -s 0 -e 0 dat -l dat/planes/planes.list

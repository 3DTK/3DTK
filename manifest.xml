     Slam6D - This project consists of a software to register 3D point clouds
     into a common coordinate system, as well as a viewer to display the scene.
     For the registration, different ICP minimizing algorithms can be chosen,
     as well as global relaxation methods, aiming at generating an overall
     globally consistent scene. Several formats for the point clouds are
     supported, new formats can be implemented easily.

  lasoverlap:

  This tool reads LIDAR points from LAS/LAZ/ASCII/BIN/SHP and
  checks the flight line overlap and / or the vertical and
  horizontal alignment.

  The most important parameter '-step n' specifies the n x n
  area that of LiDAR points that are gridded on one raster
  (or pixel) that are then used for doing the overlap and/or
  difference calculations. The output is either in BIL, ASC,
  IMG, TIF, PNG, JPG, XYZ,or DTM format. When computing the
  difference in the flight line overlaps, by default the tool
  will check '-elevation_lowest', but '-intensity_highest', or
  '-density' are possible too.

  Optionally, a KML file is generated that allows the resulting
  raster  to be immediately displayed inside a geospatial context
  provided by Google Earth (for TIF/PNG/JPG images). In case the
  LAS/LAZ file contains projection information (i.e. geo keys
  as variable length records) this metadata is used to correctly
  geo-reference the KML file. It is also possible to provide the
  proper geo-referencing information in the command-line.

  Use '-subsample n' with 1 < n < 5 to anti-alias the gridding of
  LiDAR points by their x and y coordinate into disjunct rasters.
  The option '-subsample 3' adds each LiDAR point 9 times to the
  raster at locations (x/y), (x+0.33*step/y), (x+0.66*step/y),
  (x/y+0.33*step) (x+0.33*step/y+0.33*step) (x+0.66*step/y+0.33*step),
  (x/y+0.66*step) (x+0.33*step/y+0.66*step) (x+0.66*step/y+0.66*step)
  and thereby "washes out" hard boundaries.

example usage:

>> lasoverlap -i tile.las -step 2

creates an overlap raster as well as a difference raster with a
step of 2 units. For this, it is necessary that the LiDAR points
in the LAS file have their point source ID populated with the
flight line ID. The overlap raster uses the default color ramp
which maps overlap counts from 0 to 5 to a different colors. The
difference raster uses the default color ramp that maps blue to
-2.5, white to 0, and red to 2.5. The default output is PNG.

>> lasoverlap -i tile.las -step 2 -values -oasc

same as above but output the actual values into an ASC raster
(instead of the color-coded values into a PNG).

>> lasoverlap -i LDR*.las -files_are_flightlines -step 3 -max_diff 2

merges all the files "LDR*.las" while assigning the points of each
file a unique point source ID (aka flight line number), and then
creates an overlap raster as well as a difference raster with a step
of 3 units. The overlap raster uses the default range of 5 overlaps
lines for the color ramp. The difference raster uses '-max_diff 2'
and maps range (-2 ... 0 ... 2) to colors (blue ... white ... red).

>> lasoverlap -i LDR*.las -files_are_flightlines -step 2 -max_diff 4 -no_over

same as above but does not output an overlap raster ('-no_over') and
operates with different '-step 2' and '-max_diff 4' settings.

>> lasoverlap -i LDR*.las -files_are_flightlines -step 5 -no_diff

same as above but does not output a difference raster ('-no_diff') but
only a coarse (-step 5) overlap raster.

>> lasoverlap -i tiles*.laz -step 2 -no_over -utm 15N

operates tile by tile (e.g. creates one difference raster per file)
and generates a Google Earth KML file for each tile using UTM 15N. It
is necessary that the LiDAR points in the LAZ file have their point
source ID populated.

>> lasoverlap -i tiles*.laz -step 2 -no_over -utm 15N -intensity -highest

same as above but computes intensity differences. For intensities the
difference raster maps range -255 ... 0 ... 255 (e.g. '-max_diff 255').

>> lasoverlap -i tiles*.laz -step 2 -no_over -utm 15N -intensity -highest

same as above but computes density differences. For densities the
difference raster maps range -100 ... 0 ... 100 (e.g. '-max_diff 100').

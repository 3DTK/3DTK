  lasground:

  This is a tool for bare-earth extraction: it classifies LIDAR
  points into ground points (class = 2) and non-ground points
  (class = 1). This tools works very well in natural environments
  such as mountains, forests, fields, hills, or other terrain
  with few man-made objects.

  The tool also produces excellent results for town or cities
  but buildings larger than the step size can be problematic.
  The default step size is 5 meters, which is good for forest
  or mountains. For towns or flat terrains '-town' the step
  size is increased to 10 meters. For cities or warehouses
  '-city' the step size is increased to 25 meters. For very
  large cities use '-metro' and the step size is increased
  to 50 meters You can also set it directly with '-step 35'.

  It is important to tell the tool whether the horizontal and
  vertical units are meters (which is assumed by default) or
  '-feet' or '-elevation_feet'. Should the LAS file contain
  projection information then there is no need to specify this
  explicitly. If the input coordinates are in an earth-centered
  or a longlat representation, the file needs converted to, for
  example, a UTM projection first. That said, some folks have
  successfully ground-classified longlat represtations using a
  very small '-step 0.000005' or so.

  By default the tool only considers the last return. Earlier
  returns are considered non-ground. You can turn this off by
  requesting '-all_returns'. If you want to leave out certain
  classifications from the bare-earth calculation you can do
  so with '-ignore_class 6'.

  For very steep hills you can intensify the search for initial
  ground points with '-fine' or '-extra_fine' and similarly for
  flat terrains you can simplify the search with '-coarse' or
  '-extra_coarse' but try the default setting first. 

  The experienced user can fine-tune the algorithm by specifing
  the threshold in meters at which spikes get removed. setting
  '-spike 0.5' will remove up-spikes above 50 centimeter and
  down-spikes below 5 meters in the coarsest TIN.

  The maximal standard deviation for planar patches in centimeter
  can be set with '-stddev 10' and the maximal offset in meters up
  to which points above the current ground estimate get included
  can be set with '-offset 0.1'.

  Please license from martin.isenburg@gmail.com to use lasground
  commercially. Please note that the unlicensed version will set
  intensity, gps_time, user data, and point source ID to zero,
  slightly change the LAS point order, and randomly add a tiny
  bit of white noise to the points coordinates.

example usage:

>> lasground -i terrain.las -o classified_terrain.las

classifies a terrain with the default settings.

>> lasground -i terrain.las -o classified_terrain.las -feet -elevation_feet

classifies a terrain where both horizontal and vertical units are
in feet instead of in meters (which is assumed by default unless
there is projection information in the LAS file saying otherwise).

>> lasground -i terrain.las -o classified_terrain.las -all_returns

classifies a terrain considering all points - not just the last
returns (as is the default behavior).

>> lasground -i *.las

classifies all LAS files with the default settings.

>> lasground -i *.las -town

the same as above but uses wider spacing to allow for small
buildings and other man-made structures.

>> lasground -i *.las -city

the same as above but uses even wider spacing to allow for
very large buildings.

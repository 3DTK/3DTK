  lastile:

  tiles a potentially very large amount of LAS points from one
  or many files into square non-overlapping tiles of a specified
  size and save them into LAS or LAZ format. 

  The square tiling used by lastile is chosen for two reasons:

  (a) it is by far the most common way that LAS files are tiled
      for archival or distribution

  (b) it will (eventually) be exploited by our "streaming TIN"
      generation code to seamlessly Delaunay triangulate large
      amounts of tiles in a highly memory-efficient fashion. For
      that purpose, lastile adds a small VLR to the header of
      each generated LAS/LAZ tile that stored its index or its
      "finalization tag" in the square quad tree.

  The tool can either operate in one or in two reading passes
  via a commandline switch (-extra_pass). The additional reading 
  pass is used to collect information about how many points fall 
  into each cell. This allows us to deallocate LASwriters for tiles
  that have seen all their points. This is *only* really needed 
  when writing LASzip compressed output of very large tilings
  to avoid having the LASwriters using LASzip compression for
  all tiles in memory at the same time.

  Optionally the tool can also create a small '-buffer 10' 
  around every tile where the parameter 10 specifies the number
  of units each tile is (temporarily) grown in each direction. It
  is possible to remove the buffer from a tile by running with
  '-remove_buffer' option.

  Optionally the tool can also create an '-reversible' tiling
  that will allow to recreate the original file from all the
  individual tiles. This is useful to, for example, break a
  large LAS file into many tiles with buffers, classify each
  tile individually with lasclassify.exe or compute the height
  of each point with lasheight.exe, and then put the original
  large LAS file back together with '-reverse_tiling'. Note
  that for the unlicensed version the gps_time is set to zero
  and the point are permutated a tiny bit.

  In order to prevent the bounding box in the LAS header from
  being shrunk to the actual extent of the points and set it
  to the full extent of the corresponding tile use '-full_bb'.
  This will pad the tiles to tile size plus buffer when run
  in '-buffer 20' mode. Used together with '-remove_buffer'
  this option results all tiles being set to the full extent
  of each tile after the offset was removed.

  To shift the tiling off its standard modulo tile_size tiling
  you can use the '-tile_ll 25 75' option.

example usage:

>> lastile -i *.las -o tiles

tiles all points from all files using the default tile size of 1000.

>> lastile -i *.las -o tiles -full_bb

same but sets the bounding box in the header to the full extend of
all tiles (rather than to the actual extent of its points).

>> lastile -i *.las -o tiles -buffer 10

the same but each tile gets all buffer points for 10 units. you can
remove the buffer points with 'lastile -i tiles*.las -remove_buffer'

>> lastile -i large.laz -o tiles -olaz -tile_size 500 -buffer 10 -reversible

tiles file 'large.laz' with tile size 500 and buffer 10 in reversible
mode. using 'lastile -i tiles*.laz -reverse_tiling -o reversed.laz' the
buffer points are removed and original point order is re-constructed
in file 'reversed.laz'.

>> lastile -i *.txt -iparse xyzti -o tiles

same but with on-the-fly converted ASCII input

>> lastile -i in1.las in2.las in3.las -o sydney -tile_size 500

tiles the points from the three LAS files with a tile size of 500. 

>> lastile -lof obx_files.txt -o outer_banks -tile_size 100 -keep_class 2 3

tiles all LAS/LAZ files listed in the text file with a tile size
of 100 keeping only points with classification 2 or 3

>> lastile -i file_list.txt -lof -o omaha -olaz -extra_pass

tiles all LAS/LAZ files listed in the text file into a LASzip
compressed tiling using the default tile size of 1000 and uses
an extra read pass in an attempt to use less memory.

>> lastile -i huge.laz -o toronto -last_only -olaz

tiles the last returns from huge.laz into compressed tiling.

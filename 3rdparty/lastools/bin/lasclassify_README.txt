  lasclassify:

  This tool classifies buildings and high vegetation (i.e. trees)
  in LAS/LAZ files. This tool requires that the bare-earth points
  have already been identified (e.g. with lasground) and that the
  elevation of each point above the ground was already computed
  with lasheight (which stores this height in the 'user data' field
  of each point).

  The tool essentially tries to find neighboring points that are
  at least 2 meter (or 6 feet) above the ground and form '-planar 0.1'
  (= roofs) or '-ragged 0.4' (= trees) regions. You can change the
  above the ground threshold with '-ground_offset 5'.

  If your data is very noisy the tool have trouble finding planar
  regions. Try playing with the '-planar 0.1' default. Often the
  flight lines are not properly aligned which will also destroy
  planarity. Here you may be better served to process your flight
  lines separately from another.

  It is also important to tell the tool whether the horizontal
  and vertical units are meters (which is assumed by default)
  or '-feet' or '-elevation_feet'. Should the LAS file contain
  projection information then there is no need to specify this
  explicitly. If the input coordinates are in an earth-centered
  or a longlat representation, the file needs converted to, for
  example, a UTM projection first.

  The experienced user can fine-tune the algorithm by specifing
  a threshold until which points are considered planar with
  '-planar 0.2'. This would roughly correspond to a standard
  deviation of up to 0.2 meters that neighboring points can have
  from the planar region they share. The default is 0.1 meters.

  Please license from martin.isenburg@gmail.com to use lasclassify
  commercially. Please note that the unlicensed version will set
  intensity, gps_time, user data, and point source ID to zero,
  slightly change the LAS point order, and randomly add a tiny
  bit of white noise to the points coordinates.

example usage:

>> lasground -i lidar.las -o lidar_with_bare_earth.las -city
>> lasheight -i lidar_with_bare_earth.las -o lidar_with_heights.las
>> lasclassify -i lidar_with_heights.las -o lidar_classified.las

finds the ground points with lasground, computes the height of each
point with lasheight, and classifies buildings and high vegetation
with the default settings.

>> lasground -i lidar.las -o lidar_with_bare_earth.las -city -feet -elevation_feet
>> lasheight -i lidar_with_bare_earth.las -o lidar_with_heights.las
>> lasclassify -i lidar_with_heights.las -o lidar_classified.las -feet -elevation_feet

the same as above for LIDAR where both horizontal and vertical units
are in feet instead of in meters (meters are assumed by default unless
there is projection information in the LAS file saying otherwise).

>> lasclassify -i *.las

classifies all LAS files with the default settings (the LAS files need
to already have ground points classified and point heigths computed).

>> lasclassify -i *.laz

classifies all LAZ files with the default settings (the LAZ files need
to already have ground points classified and point heigths computed).

>> lasclassify -i *.laz -planar 0.2

experimental. same as above but more points will be joined into roofs.

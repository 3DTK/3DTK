Ubuntu 14.04 and Debian Jessie
==============================

The easiest way to make sure that you install the right dependencies for
unpackaged software like 3dtk on Debian based distributions is to build a meta
package using the equivs tool. For 3dtk we ship the control information of such
a meta package in the svn repository so that you can use the equivs tool to
build and install a meta package which will then in turn make sure that you
have all the required dependencies on your system. The advantage compared to
installing all dependencies manually is that removing the meta package
3dtk-build-deps you created will also automatically remove all the dependencies
that were installed with it and are

$ echo deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu trusty main universe | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list > /dev/null
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends equivs subversion
$ svn checkout svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/slam6d/code/trunk slam6d-code
$ cd slam6d-code
$ equivs-build doc/equivs/control
$ sudo dpkg -i 3dtk-build-deps_1.0_all.deb
$ sudo apt-get -f install --no-install-recommends
$ make
$ bin/slam6D dat
$ bin/show dat

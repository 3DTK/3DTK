Always remember Arnold's Laws of Documentation:

  (1) If it should exist, it doesn't.
  (2) If it does exist, it's out of date.
  (3) Only documentation for useless programs transcends the
      first two laws.


If you're still interested in the documentation, you can generate both
a doxygen and some more information about the mathematical background
an such, by typing "make docu" in the parent directory.

Please remember: The data here is just for "playing around" with the
program.

Real, larger and more useful data sets can be downloaded from the data
repository, http://kos.informatik.uni-osnabrueck.de/3Dscans/
(or click on the "Data Repository" link on this project's web site
on Sourceforge, http://slam6d.sourceforge.net/)

Or use your own data, and if it's stored in a different format then
the onces that are already supported by our program, write your own
scan_io function. It's easy!

# Run the build with our own timeout because the vcpkg cache is not saved if
# we run into the appveyor timeout of one hour. Thus we abort after 55
# minutes (3300 seconds). Five minutes are left for the initial git clone.
#
# We use python to implement the process timeout - have fun trying to find
# how to do it using Windows tools like cmd.exe or the powershell.
#
# With cmd.exe, the script is executed inside the same process and thus you
# cannot kill it after a timeout.
#
# With powershell, Start-Job does not start the script in a way that directly
# redirects its output to standard output but only allows to collect it in the
# end.

For a detailed explanation about the programm, its usage, etc., please
refer to the high level documentation doc/documentation_HL.pdf
(esp. section 4-6, for starters).

IMPORTANT:
Take care to register scans first (bin/slam6D) before trying to
display them (bin/show), and think about using the point reduction
(see section 6) for a much faster scan matching result.

A reference manual can be found in doc/refman.pdf resp.
doc/html/index.html (type in 'make docu' to compile the doxygen
documentation for the HTML files).

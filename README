-------------------------------------------------------------------

Before compilation, copy one of the Makefile.options.X files to
generate the file "Makefile.options", with "X" depending on your
system (linux, linux with the icc compiler, macOS, etc.)

The Boost Graph Lib is needed to compile the slam6D program.
If you are using Debian just do:
aptitude install libboost-graph-dev

-------------------------------------------------------------------

For a detailed explanation of the programm, its usage, etc., please
refer to the high level documentation doc/documentation_HL.pdf
(esp. sections 4-6, for starters).

IMPORTANT:
Take care to register scans first (bin/slam6D) before trying to
display them (bin/show), and think about using the point reduction
(see section 6) for a much faster scan matching result.

A reference manual can be found in doc/refman.pdf resp.
doc/html/index.html (type in 'make docu' to compile the doxygen
documentation for the HTML files).

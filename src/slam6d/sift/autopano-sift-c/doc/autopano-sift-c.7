.SH NAME
autopano-sift \- Automatic panorama stitching package
.SH INTRODUCTION
The autopano-sift package contains a number programs to ease the creation of
panoramic images. A tedious task in panoramic image creation from many
individual images is the aligning of the images so they fit together. This is
normally done by using control points which give information about shared
image features. For example, image two images of a church. Lets assume both
images overlap so that the rooftop of the church is visible in both. By
telling a panorama software that the roof is in both images at a specific
position the images can be aligned. At least three control point pairs between
every two images are required usually.

The manual work of creating this control points can be immense. Especially for
panorama images holding more than one line of images there is a huge number of
possible overlaps.

The autopano-sift package can automatically create control point pairs by
using a combination of sophisticated algorithms and models. For most
feature-rich images it works very well, often outperforming humans in
coverage, precision and speed.

In the following, the individual utilities are introduced. If you want a quick
start, try the
.BR autopanog (1)
GUI frontend.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B autopanog
The GTK# GUI frontend for generating and matching SIFT keypoints. As a user
wanting to stitch panorama images, this is all you will ever need. See
.BR autopanog (1)

.B autopano
The keypoint matching program. It can take SIFT keypoint files as input and
produce PTO output files. See
.BR autopano (1)

.B generatekeys
The SIFT keypoint extraction program. Takes an image from you, and gives
keypoints back. Optionally can downscale the image to a given resolution, so
your memory size is cared for. See
.BR generatekeys (1)

.B showone
Show the SIFT keypoints overlayed over the source image. Use includes
debugging and tuning of SIFT parameters and to get an impression how well
spread the keypoints are. See
.BR showone (1)

.B showtwo
Do simplistic matching of SIFT keypoints between two images, without geometric
model. Use includes representing general matching quality. Optionally filter
only a given number of "best" keypoint matches. See
.BR showtwo (1)

.SH BUGS
If you find any bugs in the programs, please mail the author.

	* [r2938] Repackaged ANN kd-tree in a C - callable C++ wrapper.
	  Replaced the .cpp versions of APSCpp and APSCpp_main witn .c

	* [r2914] Major extension of APSC, now renamed autopano-sift-c, adds
	  stereographic projection and reduces memory demand.
	  Source is in subdir APSCpp. Some bugfixes in libsift in addition to
	  the change from double to float for image maps, which almost doubles
	  useful image size for generatekeys as well as autopano-sift-c.
	* [r2913] Rewrote Component_ToString to eliminate 2 bugs (one serious,
	  leading to seg faults). This fix replaces Seb's recent fix of the
	  same major bug, because I am too tired to merge them properly.

2008-02-22  tksharpless

	  ArrayList was supposed to work -- Sorry, TKS
